Random idea:
	- STUPID: In the list of a member's readings, dont include his own books!
	- A members profile could integrate other bookshelfs through syndication or widgetry?

MAIN USABILITY PROBLEMS
	- The "Home" and "Profile" link are hard to spot
	- The avatar has to be square, a lot of people dont know how to crop their photos 

BIG CHUNKS TO LEARN HOW TO DO:
	- Sharded counters
	- Paging
	- Tags, Tag browsing and Tag clouds
	- Simple rendering of RSS/Atom feeds
	- Fast loading of entity groups
	- Switching between fresh or packed resources (js/css)
	- Get profiling data up to firepython

OPTIMIZATION ROUTINE:
	- Convert template to Jinja
	- Use sprites for all icons and small images
	- Only use one or two avatar sizes and downscale them
	- Defer loading all secondary and "content" images (Ex.: avatars, covers)
	- Remove all scripts and CSS from inline
	- Can the buffer be flushed with Jinja
	- Optimize JQuery and DOM requests
	- Run pngcrush on images

POST PRODUCTION OPTIMIZATION:
	- Concatenate javascripts
	- Minify javascript and CSS

ONE-TIME CHANGES:
	- First load a low resolution wallpaper ad defer the full rezolution version
	- Setup a a cached favicon.ico
	- Enable HTTP GZip on prd server
	- Link to jquery.js at google
	- Setup jquery lazyload
